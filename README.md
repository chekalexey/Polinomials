# Polynomials

The program allows you to enter polynomials and outputs the results of their addition, subtraction and multiplication.

Input rules:

 - The xyz variables are entered in lowercase letters and the coefficients of the monomials must be before the variables.

 - The degrees of variables can take values from 0 to 9

 - You can enter it in any order, omit the signs of multiplication (*) exponentiation (^) and variables. It also supports floating-point numbers and can cite similar terms. 

The program outputs the results of addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two polynomials in a polynomial sorted by degrees of monomials.
